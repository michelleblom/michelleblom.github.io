  headline: "Despite the COVID-19 pandemic sending us Melbournians home for the
majority of the year in 2020, this past year has been a busy one on the election
auditing and analysis front. We presented three papers at EVOTE-ID'20, winning a
best paper award for 'You can do RLAs for IRV' summarising the first pilot of
our methodology for risk-limiting audits of IRV elections. Early in the year, we
presented work at IAAI on exploring whether certain mistakes, such as lost ballot
boxes, could have had caused specific candidates to lose a seat in the context
of STV elections."
