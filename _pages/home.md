  <h3>Welcome</h3>

<div class="jumbotron">
I am a Senior Research Fellow in the AI and Autonomy Lab of the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, Australia (2012-present). I completed my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Melbourne in 2011. I have rather diverse research interests that include election integrity (with a focus on post-election audits), combinatorial optimization (with a focus on algorithms for solving large problems through decomposition, local search, and the use of mathematical programming), applications of reinforcement learning, and Explainable AI.  For more detail on my work in some of these areas, head over to the Research tab!

  <h3>PhD Opportunities</h3>
  
  I am currently accepting new PhD students. If you are interested in my any facets of my work, and feel that you meet the requirements for entry into the PhD program with the Faculty of Engineering and IT (see <a href="https://study.unimelb.edu.au/find/courses/graduate/doctor-of-philosophy-engineering-and-it/how-to-apply/">here</a> for details on eligibility), please feel free to reach out to me. I am particularly interested in students that wish to work on post-election auditing (see the About and Research tabs for more details!).
