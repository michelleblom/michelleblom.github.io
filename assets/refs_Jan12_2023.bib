Traditional Golog interpreters are not designed to find the most preferred executions of a program from the perspective of an agent. Existing techniques that optimise the interpretation of Golog programs suffer from either a lack of flexibility in how preference may be expressed or require the consideration of all program executions. The presented work combines the use of argumentation to compare executions relative to a set of general comparison criteria, and the theory behind informed search techniques to reduce the cost of the search process. The use of this argumentative informed search in the interpretation of ConGolog programs (with true concurrency), and its potential to find a program execution that is the most preferred by a collection of agents, is also discussed."

                   around the world. It requires voters to rank candidates in
                   order of preference, and uses a counting algorithm that is
                   more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or
                   scoring rules. An even more complex system, the single
                   transferable vote (STV), is used when multiple candidates
                   need to be elected. The complexity of these systems has made
                   it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is
                   currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV,
                   other than a full manual count of the ballots. A new
                   approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed,
                   based on a Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed
                   analysis of this approach for ballot-polling Bayesian audits
                   of IRV elections. We compared several choices for the prior
                   distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian
                   bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings

                   to perform similarly to a full Bayesian model in practice,
                   and that an overly informative prior can give
                   counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we
                   show why creating an RLA with this model is challenging, but
                   we also suggest ways to overcome this. As well as providing
                   a practical and computationally feasible implementation of a

No techniques currently exist for computing the margin of victory (MOV) in STV elections. The MOV is the smallest number of ballot manipulations (changes, additions, and deletions) required to bring about a change in the set of elected candidates. Knowing the MOV gives insight into how much time and money should be spent on auditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes (such as ballot box losses) throw the election result into doubt—requiring a costly repeat election—or can be safely ignored. We present algorithms for computing lower and upper bounds on the MOV in STV elections. In small instances, these algorithms are able to compute exact margins."

This paper presents a practical branch-and-bound algorithm for exact IRV margin computation that substantially improves on the current best-known approach.

We describe how the process could be amended to include a demonstration that the randomness was chosen fairly. 
Second, and more significantly, we found an error in the official counting
software, which caused a mistake in the count in the council of Griffith, where
candidate Rina Mercuri narrowly missed out on a seat. We believe the software
error incorrectly decreased Mercuri's winning probability to about
10\%---according to our count she should have won with 91\% probability. 
The NSW Electoral Commission (NSWEC) corrected their code when we pointed out the error, and made their own announcement. 
We have since investigated the 2016 local government election (held after correcting the error above) and found two new errors. We notified the NSWEC about these errors a few days after they posted the results."

A short-term schedule selects regions of a mine site, known as ‘blocks’, to be extracted in each week of a planning horizon (typically spanning 13 weeks). Existing tools for constructing these schedules use greedy heuristics, with little optimization. To construct a single schedule in which infrastructure is sufficiently utilized, with production grades consistently close to a desired target, a planner must often run these heuristics many times, adjusting parameters after each iteration. A planner's intuition and experience can evaluate the relative quality and mineability of different schedules in a way that is difficult to automate. Of interest to a short-term planner is the generation of multiple schedules, extracting available ore and waste in varying sequences, which can then be manually compared. This article presents a tool in which multiple, diverse, short-term schedules are constructed, meeting a range of common objectives without the need for iterative parameter adjustment."

An N-period mixed integer program (MIP) is solved for each period in the original horizon to incrementally construct a production schedule one period at a time. This article presents a new algorithm that, in contrast, decomposes the horizon into N period-aggregates of equal size. Given a schedule for these N periods, obtained by solving an N-period MIP, the first of these aggregates is itself decomposed into an N-period scheduling problem with guidance provided on what regions of the mine should be extracted. The performance of this hierarchical decomposition-based approach is compared with that of receding horizon control on a suite of data sets generated from an operating mine producing millions of tons of ore annually. As the number of objectives being optimized increases, the hierarchical decomposition-based algorithm outperforms receding horizon control, in a majority of instances."

problem in which: multiple supply item types are transported between suppliers

decentralized manner. Sink nodes consume dynamically varying demands (whose
timing and size are not known a priori). Network arcs, and vehicles, experience
failures at times, and for durations, that are not known a priori. These dynamic
events are caused by an adversary, seeking to disrupt the network. We design
domain-dependent planning algorithms for these vehicles whose primary objective
is to minimize the likelihood of stockout events (where insufficient resource is
present at a sink to meet demand). Cost minimization is a secondary objective.
The performance of these algorithms, across varying scenarios, with and without
restrictions on communication between vehicles and network locations, is
evaluated using agent-based simulation. We show that stockpiling-based
strategies, where quantities of resource are amassed at strategic locations, are
most effective on large land-based networks with multiple supply item types,
with simpler “shuttling”-based approaches being sufficient otherwise."

We highlight the differences between short- and longer term planning in terms of both the level of detail to which a mine site is modelled, and the objectives that are optimised when making decisions. We summarise the range of techniques that have been developed for generating short-term plans, capturing both mathematical programming-based methods and heuristic approaches using local-search and decomposition.

It is often assumed that the true margin is the last-round margin, that is half the difference between the two candidates who remain when everyone else is eliminated, though it is well known that this need not be the case. Perceptions of confidence in the outcome, and even formal policies about recounts, often depend on the last-round margin. There is already some prior work on how to compute the true election margin efficiently for IRV, and hence how to find the minimal manipulation. In this work we show how to manipulate an election efficiently while also producing a large last-round margin. This would allow a succesful manipulation to evade detection against naive methods of assessing the confidence of the election result. This serves as further evidence for accurate computations of the exact margin, or for rigorous Risk Limiting Audits which would detect a close or wrong election result (respectively) regardless of the last-round margin."

Previous work in this area looked at posthoc manipulation with complete information, where the manipulator may alter ballots after reading the whole election profile. In this paper we examine the much more realistic, but challenging, problem of manipulating ballots during the election process, having observed only some ballots. The aim of the manipulator is to modify as few ballots as possible to ensure their candidate’s victory with high probability. We show that this it quite feasible in practice to generate efficient manipulations with a high probability of success. We also add some extra conditions on the manipulations so it is less likely they will be detected by naive methods."

In the 2013 Australian Federal Election, for example, 1,370 West Australian Senate ballots were lost, eventually leading to a costly re-run of the election. Other mistakes include ballots that are misrecorded by electronic voting systems, voters that cast invalid ballots, or vote multiple times at different polling locations. We present a method for assessing whether such problems could have made a difference to the outcome of a Single Transferable Vote (STV) election – a complex system of preferential voting for multi-seat elections. It is used widely in Australia, in Ireland, and in a range of local government elections in the United Kingdom and United States."

In this paper we construct manipulations of the ballots in order to change the overall balance of power in an Australian Federal Senate election – the upper house of Parliament. This gives, hopefully tight, over-estimations of the Margin of Victory (MOV) for the party or coalition winning the Senate. This is critical information for determining how well we can trust the reported results, and how much auditing should be applied to the election process to be certain that it reports the true result. The challenge arising in Australian Federal Senate elections is that they use a complicated Single Transferable Vote (STV) method for which it is intractable to compute the true MOV, hence we must rely on greedy methods to find small manipulations."

Here we examine the effect of random errors on Single Transferable Vote (STV) elections, a common approach to deciding multi-seat elections. It is usually expected that random errors should have nearly equal effects on all candidates, and thus be fair. We find to the contrary that random errors can introduce systematic bias into election results. This is because, even if the errors are random, votes for different candidates occur in different patterns that are affected differently by random errors. In the STV context, the most important effect of random errors is to invalidate the ballot. This removes far more votes for those candidates whose supporters tend to list a lot of preferences, because their ballots are much more likely to be invalidated by random error. Different validity rules for different voting styles mean that errors are much more likely to penalise some types of votes than others. For close elections this systematic bias can change the result of the election."

While methods differ by state and party, many primaries involve proportional delegate allocation using the so-called Hamilton method. In this paper we show how to conduct risk-limiting audits for delegate allocation elections using variants of the Hamilton method where the viability of candidates is determined either by a plurality vote or using instant runoff voting. Experiments on real-world elections show that we can audit primary elections to high confidence (small risk limits) usually at low cost."

Ballot-polling audits select ballots at random and interpret those ballots as evidence for and against the reported result, continuing this process until either they support the recorded result, or they fall back to a full manual recount. For elections with digitised scanning and counting of ballots, a comparison audit compares randomly selected digital ballots with their paper versions. Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections. We show that for almost all real elections we found, we can perform a risk-limiting audit by looking at only a small fraction of the total ballots (assuming no errors were made in the tallying and distribution of votes)."

  abstract = "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs), an ingredient in evidence-based elections, are increasingly common. They are a rigorous statistical means of ensuring that electoral results are correct, usually without having to perform an expensive full recount -- at the cost of some controlled probability of error. A recently developed approach for conducting RLAs, SHANGRLA, provides a flexible framework that can encompass a wide variety of social choice functions and audit strategies. Its flexibility comes from reducing sufficient conditions for outcomes to be correct to canonical `assertions' that have a simple mathematical form. 
Assertions have been developed for auditing various social choice functions including plurality, multi-winner plurality, super-majority, Hamiltonian methods, and instant runoff voting. However, there is no systematic approach to building assertions. Here, we show that assertions with linear dependence on transformations of the votes can easily be transformed to canonical form for SHANGRLA. We illustrate the approach by constructing assertions for party-list elections such as Hamiltonian free list elections and elections using the D'Hondt method, expanding the set of social choice functions to which SHANGRLA applies directly."
